 🏡 Overall Story:

The Housing dataset paints a vivid picture of a diverse real estate market.  

- Bigger houses generally cost more, but outliers in both area and price show that some properties defy expectations.  
- Furnished homes tend to command premium prices.  
- More bedrooms often push prices higher, but location and amenities can make a smaller home just as valuable as a larger one.  

💡 The data tells us one thing clearly:  
In real estate, numbers matter — but the real story lies in the unique combination of size, features, and desirability.
