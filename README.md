🏡 Housing Data Storytelling Dashboard

This is an interactive Streamlit app that explores and visualizes the Housing Price Dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about the real estate market.

The project uses data storytelling — each chart comes with a narrative that explains what the numbers reveal.

📜 Example Output

* Distribution of House Area → Most homes are modest in size, but a few giant houses skew the graph to the right.
* Furnishing Status → Furnished homes sell for more on average, suggesting buyers value move-in readiness.
* Overall Story → Bigger houses often cost more, but location, furnishing, and amenities can make a smaller home equally valuable.
